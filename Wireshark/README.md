##  Identified DoS Attack Activity

Two distinct attack phases were detected.

---

#  TCP SYN Flood

### **Time Window:** ~243.1s to ~290.3s

### **Attack Rate:** ~992 packets/second

### **Protocol:** TCP

### **Target:** `192.168.10.30` (port **0**)

### **Source:** `192.168.20.10`

####  Characteristics

* Continuous **TCP SYN** packets
* Always sent to **port 0** (invalid port — indicates crafted attack traffic)
* Victim replies with **RST, ACK** for each packet
* No valid three-way handshake

####  Example Packets

```text
243.123555  192.168.20.10 → 192.168.10.30  TCP 2748 → 0 [SYN] Seq=0 Win=512 Len=0
243.123571  192.168.20.10 → 192.168.10.30  TCP 2749 → 0 [SYN] Seq=0 Win=512 Len=0
```

Victim response:

```text
243.125861  192.168.10.30 → 192.168.20.10  TCP 0 → 2748 [RST, ACK] Seq=1 Ack=1 Win=0 Len=0
```

#### Conclusion

This is a high-rate **TCP SYN flood attack**, likely generated by a tool such as **hping3** or **nping**.

---

# UDP Flood Attack

### **Time Window:** ~375.9s to ~398.3s

### **Attack Rate:** ~1,509 packets/second

### **Protocol:** UDP

### **Target:** `192.168.10.30` (port **80**)

### **Source:** `192.168.20.10`

####  Characteristics

* Sequential source ports (2791, 2792, 2793…)
* Destination port always **80**
* Payload length **0 bytes**
* Extremely high packet rate

#### Example Packets

```text
375.906353  192.168.20.10 → 192.168.10.30  UDP 2791 → 80 Len=0
375.906399  192.168.20.10 → 192.168.10.30  UDP 2792 → 80 Len=0
```

####  Conclusion

This traffic is a classic **UDP flood** aimed at the victim’s web service port.

##  ICMP Behavior During Attack

Throughout the capture, the attacker continuously pings the victim:

```text
40.937210  192.168.20.10 → 192.168.10.30  ICMP Echo request
40.944589  192.168.10.30 → 192.168.20.10  ICMP Echo reply
```

**Purpose:**
To monitor victim responsiveness during DoS activity (typical for lab tests).

---

##  DNS & Routing Issues (Unrelated to DoS)

Host `192.168.10.40` repeatedly sends DNS queries to **8.8.8.8**, but the router **10.0.0.1** returns:

```text
ICMP Destination Unreachable (Host Unreachable)
```

This indicates:

* Upstream routing failure, OR
* Internet connectivity issue in the lab environment.

Not related to the attacks.

---

## 🛠 Other LAN Background Traffic

The following normal LAN protocols were also seen:

* ARP
* STP (Spanning Tree)
* LLMNR
* mDNS
* CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol)
* NBNS
* SMB browser packets

These are all expected in a switched network environment.

# Final Assessment

The Wireshark capture **clearly documents a two-phase DoS attack** from `192.168.20.10` against `192.168.10.30`.

### ✔ Attack Phases

| Phase | Type          | Rate      | Target                  |
| ----- | ------------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
| 1     | TCP SYN Flood | ~992 pps  | `192.168.10.30` port 0  |
| 2     | UDP Flood     | ~1500 pps | `192.168.10.30` port 80 |

### ✔ Conclusion

The attack was **intentional** and designed to overwhelm the victim's network stack using high-volume, low-payload packets. All other traffic in the capture supports a typical lab or GNS3 test environment.
